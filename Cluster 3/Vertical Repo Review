OpenBook Vertical Repo Review

High level review: The repo works as a DeFi infrastructure for Solana projects.

Initially as built on top of SerumDEX project, the entrypoint (business logic) is defined on lib.rs on each separate folder by using Anchor. 

The code has been organized into functions, enums, structs which define each process (open book, sell, create position etc.) and to import other files,
mod or use has been frequently used to make other files work. So, it works as a financial infrastructure for anyone wanting to create DEX or other DeFi 
instruments.
